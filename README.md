# Project title (ifpan-kolasa-intramural)

#### Project logline (technique, organism, tissue type)
Molecular mechanisms of the antidepressant effect of psilocybin using an animal model of treatment-resistant depression. 
FACS (Fluorescence-AcFvated Cell Sorter), Rattus norvegicus, cells from a selected part of the brain.


## Methods
This sections should be a description of preprocessin and analysis ready to be included in the publication.
Through this methodology, we aim to precisely understand how psilocybin impacts small RNA profiles in the context of depression.

### *nf-core/smrnaseq*
This pipeline is built on Nextflow, enabling flexible and reproducible analysis across various computational environments. The nf-core/smrnaseq pipeline is specifically tailored for small RNA sequencing data, making it ideal for our study's requirements.

## Preprocessing

## Analysis
Details of analysis

*notes: all files included in the repo need to be referenced, either in README or other .md files. The analysis has to be fully reproducible, in principle the repo should contain code + description of how to run it while data and results kept outside*
